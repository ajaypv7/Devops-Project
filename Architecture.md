# Cloud Architecture for Application Deployment

## Architecture Overview

This document outlines the cloud architecture designed to deploy and manage the application on Azure.

### Components

- **Resource Group**: A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.
- **Azure SQL Database**: Provides a managed database service for the application.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: To manage Docker containers.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: To store Docker container images.
- **Key Vaults**: For Storing Secrets.
- **Azure Storage**: Store Sql Logs.

### Scalability

The infrastructure is designed to scale automatically using Azure's Autoscale feature, which adjusts resources based on load.

## Monitoring and Auditing

- **Azure Monitor**: Collects and analyzes performance metrics and logs.
- **Azure Policy**: Enforces organizational standards and assesses compliance.
- **Log Analytics workspace**: For monitoring Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Personal Account Management

Personal accounts are managed through Azure Active Directory, providing secure access to the application.

## Deployment Pipeline

The `azure-pipelines.yml` file defines the CI/CD process, which includes stages for building, deploying, and monitoring the application.

## Conclusion

The architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and compliant with organizational policies.
