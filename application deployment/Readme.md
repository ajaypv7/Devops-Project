To set up a CI/CD pipeline for an application with a Java backend and a React frontend, you’ll need to create two separate pipelines: one for the backend and one for the frontend. Each pipeline will build, test, containerize, and deploy its respective part of the application. Here’s a high-level overview of what each pipeline will do:

Backend Pipeline (Java)
Source Code Checkout: Pull the latest code from the repository branch designated for the backend.
Build: Compile the Java code and package it into an executable JAR or WAR file.
Test: Run unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality.
Dockerize: Build a Docker image with the Java application, tagging it appropriately.
Push to Registry: Push the Docker image to a container registry like Azure Container Registry.
Deploy: Deploy the Docker container to the target infrastructure, which could be an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster or Azure App Service.
Frontend Pipeline (React)
Source Code Checkout: Pull the latest code from the repository branch designated for the frontend.
Build: Install dependencies and build the React application into static files.
Test: Run linting and unit tests to ensure code quality.
Dockerize: Build a Docker image with the React static files served by a web server like Nginx, tagging it appropriately.
Push to Registry: Push the Docker image to a container registry.
Deploy: Deploy the Docker container to the target infrastructure, similar to the backend.
